    <h2>Just a letter from the one who adores you</h2>
    <p>You know, sometimes I just sit back and wonder how someone like you even exists. 
        Like—how does one person get to be this beautiful and this kind? Your smile? Instant serotonin. 
        Your eyes? They hold more depth than any ocean I’ve seen, like they’ve watched entire universes unfold and still chose softness. 
        Your cheeks glow like you’ve been kissed by the sun itself. Your voice? That gentle tone that could calm storms inside me.</p>
    <p>It's not just that; it's how you say my name as if it really means something. The way you laugh in the middle of a sentence shows you’re bursting with happiness. 
        You listen so well, and your words feel warm, like a cozy cup of tea on a cold winter day. You have a gentle nature, but you're definitely not fragile—there's a calm power in you, 
        like the glow of the moon.....</p>
